# Pull Request: Integrate Flax Library for Kernel Mode Execution

## Description
This pull request aims to integrate the Flax library for execution in kernel mode. The changes made in this pull request include modifications to the `linen/module.py` file to adapt the core components and mechanisms of the Flax library for compatibility with the custom kernel environment.

## Changes Made
- Modified `linen/module.py` to support execution in kernel mode.
- Adapted core components and mechanisms of the Flax library for kernel compatibility.

## Purpose
The purpose of these changes is to enable the execution of Flax models within the custom kernel environment. This integration is a crucial step towards achieving the user's goal of building a custom kernel that can execute .deb, .exe, and .apk files, and integrate TensorFlow models without using TensorFlow's API.

## Next Steps
- Review and merge the changes into the main branch.
- Continue with the integration of TensorFlow models and ensure the execution of .deb, .exe, and .apk files in the custom kernel.
- Test the kernel to ensure it works as expected on x86, x64, and Android systems.
